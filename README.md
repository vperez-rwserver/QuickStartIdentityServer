# Quick Start Identity Server

This project is the result of following the steps on the [documentation for Identity Server 4](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/release/quickstarts/0_overview.html)

The purpose is to use it as a prototype of SSO authentication from a legacy database of users and test how easy is to integrate different Oauth2 libraries to it.

It is published to github so it can be pulled and built automatically on Azure.
